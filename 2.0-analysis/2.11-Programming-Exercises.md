1. Devise an experiment to verify that the list index operator is **_O_(1)**

2. `Devise an experiment to verify that get item and set item are **_O_(1)** for dictionaries.`

3. Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the del operator on lists and dictionaries.

4. `Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in **_O_(nlog(n))** to find the kth smallest number in the list.`

5. Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be linear? Explain.
